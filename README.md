# Movie_recommendationML
Made a simple Movie recommendation system using one the concepts of recommendation systems. This is certainly one of the easier pieces of code for a recommendation system. Will try to update it regularly and try to make into a web App. The list of movies and their numbers were taking from imdb pages through web scrapping and kaggle dataset. You can refer to the code and use it when you yourself want to make a recommendation system. Any feedbacks will be much appreciated.
